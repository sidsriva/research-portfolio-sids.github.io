    My research focuses on extending, specializing, and developing novel ML/AI methods for computational mechanics. These methods are rooted in classical physics and mathematical analysis and are referred as scientific learning methods for their relevance to scientific computing techniques. 
    Following attributes are desired from these methods: 
    <ul>
    <li> utilizing real-life experimental data, </li>
    <li> amenability to mathematical analysis, and </li>
    <li> transferability to new hardware systems appearing in the Post-Moore era.</li>
    </ul>
